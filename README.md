# teamwebsite

This is the template for the teamwebsite. Sorry if you get lost in my code I am a mess but I tried to add comments to guide you peasents. But you guys only have to change the text, decorations(optional) and images. So I think it will be fine.

- Dont mess around with the ID's and try to stay away from most classes. 

- If you change an image, please give the file in the assets/IMG folder this name: [your name], [your name2], [your name3] etc. Do this so it won't mess up other peoples images. All the images of everyone should be in the assets/IMG folder, don't overwrite or delete the images of other people.

- It would be best to keep all the colours the same to create more of a coherent theme but pink girly so, if you change it try to follow my colourscheme like this: If you use blue for example use darker blue on elements that I also made darker, same with lighter colours. I used this colour scheme genrator: https://coolors.co/ I recommend using it.

# stuff you need to change
- text (content 1, content 2, content 3) 
- change the img url in HTML to your own images
- decorations (optional)
- social media icons in the footer, change the link

### Don't forget to put this folder into your 'C:\xampp\htdocs' folder for windows and the '/var/www/html' folder for linux, or you won't be able to run PHP files.
