# teamwebsite

This is the template for the teamwebsite. Sorry if you get lost in my code I am a mess but I tried to add comments to guide you peasents. But you guys only have to change the text, decorations(optional) and images. So I think it will be fine.

- Dont mess around with the ID's and try to stay away from most classes. 

- If you change an image, please give it this class name: [your name].jpg/png, [your name2].jpg/png, [your name3].jpg/png etc. Do this so it won't mess up other peoples images.

- It would be best to keep all the colours the same to create more of a coherent theme but pink gay so, if you change it try to follow my colourscheme like this: If you use blue for example use darker blue on elements that I also made darker, same with lighter colours. 

# stuff you need to change
- text (content 1, content 2, content 3) 
- images 
- decorations (optional)
- social media icons in the footer, change the link
